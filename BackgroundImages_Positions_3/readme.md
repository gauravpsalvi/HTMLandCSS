Adding a Background Image using css and setting position to multiple div's

Features of the project:

- Banner Image added using css properties like "background-image: url('path')"
- "background-size: 100% 100%;" Property used to set full width banner image
- Background Image gets repeated by default so we have used "background-repeat: no-repeat" property in order to eliminate the repetition
- Using "position: absolute" has been added to place text on top of banner image
- Navigation Bar displayed vertically
