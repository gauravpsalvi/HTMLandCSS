            <h2>Created by Rebecca Moses Dmello (300322984)</h2>
            <strong>CSIS 1280:</strong><em> Multimedia Web Development</em> is a first level course where learn <strong><cite>HTML,CSS</cite></strong> and <strong><cite>JavaScript</cite></strong>. It is really <del>
            cool!</del><ins> Awesome!</ins><br/>The first lab is easy peasy though since we just need to create a simple page with basic html tags.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use <cite>Web Programing by John Dean</cite> as our textbook. Note that I refer the textbook using the &lt;cite&gt; tag.<hr>
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is an example of a JavaScript function that handles an <cite>onChange</cite> event. Notice that JavaScript can be used to change the CSS<br>
            style and text content of an element.<br>
            The code shown below is created using <cite>code</cite> and <cite>pre</cite> elements.<br>
            <br>
            <pre>
                function changeBg(){
            
                    var index = document.getElementById("colorsel").selectedIndex;
                    if(index &lt; 1)
                        alert("please select one of the colors");
                    else{
                        var color = obj.options[index].value;
                        var obj2 =document.getElementById("td_text");
                        obj2.style="background-color: " + color;
                        obj2.children[0].textContent = "My color is now " + color;
                    }
                }
            </pre>

            The HTML5 standard is maintained by <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C.</abbr> Hover your mouse on the W3C <ins>abbr</ins>eviation to know its <ins>d</ins>e<ins>f</ins>i<ins>n</ins>ition. 
            This is done using the<br>
            <cite>dfn</cite> and <cite>abbr</cite> elements. Quoting their website, W3C mission is <q>To lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing <br>
            protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web</q>. The quotation in the previous sentence was made using the <cite>q</cite><br> 
            element.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <cite>blockquote</cite> element is for a block of quotation where you can also put a heading such as shown below
            <blockquote>
                <strong>The blockquote</strong><br>
                <br>
                The blockquote element represents a section that is quoted from another source. Content inside a blockquote must be <br>
                quoted from another source, whose address, if it has one, may be cited in the cite attribute. 
            </blockquote>
